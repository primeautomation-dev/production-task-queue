# Production Task Queue

A production-style backend task queue system designed to demonstrate
reliability, worker execution, and test-driven backend engineering.

## What this project shows

- Task enqueue & dequeue mechanics
- Worker-based task execution
- Clear separation of queue, core logic, and worker layers
- Deterministic task handling (no duplicate execution)
- Fully passing unit and integration tests

## Why this exists

Many backend systems rely on background task processing.
This project focuses on **clarity, correctness, and testability**
rather than frameworks or UI.

It is built to reflect how real backend systems are structured in production.

## Tech highlights

- Python
- Explicit queue abstraction
- Worker execution flow
- Unit + integration tests (pytest)
- Clean package structure

## Status

All tests passing.

This repository is intended as a **portfolio-quality backend project**
showing production-oriented thinking rather than a full product.
